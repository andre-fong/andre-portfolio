              In the winter of 2023, I had the great pleasure of starting my

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              Verto&apos;s main mission was to bring a modern solution to the
              outdated world of healthcare that still saw the use of paper files
              and fax machines (sadly). Throughout the past 4 months, I&apos;ve
              become a key part of the QA team and grown attached to
              Verto&apos;s culture and its people.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              Our growing QA team was in charge of a{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>robust automated test suite </span>
              that ran against all of Verto&apos;s technical solutions. The
              suite was maintained in Javascript using{" "}
              <a
                href="https://www.cypress.io/"

                Cypress

              and mostly consisted of end-to-end tests, simulating how clients
              would use our software.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              Alongside bug reporting, I played a large part in maintaining our
              existing test suite, ranging from fixing faulty test logic to
              adding new tests to cover new features. Frequent communication
              with cross-functional teams was key, especially the adjacent
              product and full-stack teams.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              I also had the opportunity to work on several innovation projects
              - one aimed to add{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>copy-and-paste functionality </span>
              to Cypress, a currently unsupported feature. This had previously
              been a blocker for QA, as it was a common use case for our clients
              that had remained untested. The new feature has since been rolled
              out to existing tests â€” along with Typescript intellisense support
              to boot.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              While I found success in the QA process, I also recently had the
              chance to embark on a project outside the scope of QA duties,
              marking the beginning of{" "}

              testing.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              A quick rundown on Lighthouse: Google&apos;s Lighthouse is a tool
              that scores performance metrics for a website, including{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>load time</span>,{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>accessibility</span>, and{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>best practices</span>. Lighthouse
              generates performance reports with actionable recommendations for
              improvement, making it a great tool for developers as well.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              As the company behind over{" "}
              <span className={styles.bold}>8.5M patients served</span> using
              digital healthcare solutions, Verto was in need of a way to
              enforce accessibility and performance standards for our
              patient-facing solutions. This is where automated Lighthouse
              testing comes in.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              Fast forward to April 2023, I successfully integrated scheduled
              Lighthouse tests into our patient-facing solutions to keep track
              of accessibility and performance metrics. In addition, I connected
              these tests to Verto&apos;s own Lighthouse server so that reports
              can be stored and performance trends can be monitored.
